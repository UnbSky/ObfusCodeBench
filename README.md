# ObfusCodeBench
**ObfusCodeBench** is a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate large language models’ abilities in code understanding and code generation under various code obfuscation techniques.

## Dataset Overview
All data are stored in the `data` directory, which contains **four sub-datasets**:
- **data_wcode_wero.json**  
  This dataset includes code generated by three obfuscators (**PyObfuscator, JarObfuscate, Proguard**), the original code, and gold-standard code summaries.  
  It is used to evaluate large language models on **code summarization** and **code deobfuscation** across different obfuscators.
- **data_wcode_wero.json**  
  This dataset includes code generated by five obfuscation techniques (**IE, NE, SE, JII, JII+DFI**), the original code, and gold-standard code summaries.  
  This dataset is **restricted to the Java language** and is used to evaluate large language models on **code summarization** and **code deobfuscation** under different obfuscation strategies.
- **clone_data_wcode_wero.json**  
  This dataset contains clone pairs and non-clone pairs constructed from code generated by three obfuscators (**PyObfuscator, JarObfuscate, Proguard**) and the original code.  
  It is used to evaluate large language models on **code clone detection** across different obfuscators.
- **clone_data_wcode_wero.json**  
  This dataset contains clone pairs and non-clone pairs constructed from code generated by five obfuscation techniques (**IE, NE, SE, JII, JII+DFI**) and the original code.  
  This dataset is **restricted to the Java language** and is used to evaluate large language models on **code clone detection** under different obfuscation strategies.

## Data Construction
The `src` directory contains the core code used for dataset construction, including:
- code compilation and decompilation utilities, and  
- implementations for applying the three obfuscators.

Due to the complexity of the original codebase, we will release the complete data construction and evaluation code after further organization and cleanup in a future update.
